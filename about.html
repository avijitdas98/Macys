	<p>In <u>1858</u>, a small dry goods shop opened its doors on the comer of 14th Street and 6th Avenue in <b>New York City</b>.
	 Over 150 years and 800 stores later, we've proudly grown into "America's Department Store," bringing our customers
	 an experience that goes beyond just everyday shopping. Take a look back at some of the defining moments in Macy's history.</P>
	<ul>
	<li>1830 Shillito's is founded in Cincinnati by John Shillito.</li>
	<li>1841 Eben Jordan and Benjamin L. Marsh open Jordan Marsh in Boston.</li>
	<li>185 1F&R Lazarus & Company is founded in Columbus, OH by Simon Lazarus.</li>
	<li>1858 Rowland H. Macy opens R.H. Macy & Co. as a dry goods store in New York City.</li>
	<li>1870 Goldsmith's is founded in Memphis.</li>
	<li>1898 Burdines is founded in Miami.</li>
	<li>1930 Bloomingdale's joins Federated.</li>
	<li>1988 Macy's purchases Bullock's and I. Magnin from Campeau Corporation.</li>
	<li>1998 Federated Launches A New Macy's By Mail catalog and re-launches macys.com.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p>Macy's responded by publishing an apology by the Macy's East chairman,
	 Ron Klein, in In Newsweekly, a Boston-area weekly with a large gay readership. 
	Klein's description of the incident as "an internal breakdown in communication",
	 further stated it was regrettable some would doubt Macy's commitment to diversity as a result.[72] The Web address was later restored â€“ the mannequins, however, 
	never made a reappearance.</p>
